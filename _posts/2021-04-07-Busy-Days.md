## Busy Days

My schedule has been full a lot in the past year, in spite of the pandemic. Organizations moving to Zoom meetings, and my geographical location being deeply rural means that I now have the ability to attend more meetings. Couple that with being involved in a lot of facets of my community and we get to a place where I am participating in a lot meetings. 

Add in trying to build an income from my business, and I fit in meeting with my clients between Zoom meetings and in-person meetings in my community.
